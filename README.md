#Complex-Python3#
###Python library for complex number algebra####
- - - -
This project is an extension to functionality of python 3 so that complex number algebra can be done gracefully with python.

**Complex.py:** The main python file. Just import this module in the main script and create object of Complex class to represent a complex number.

* `addComplex(Complex)`
>This function is called by object of `Complex` class and another object of the same class is passed as argument. It returns another object of `Complex` class with the added result of the two complex numbers.

* `subComplex(Complex)`
>This function is called by object of `Complex` class and another object of the same class is passed as argument. It returns another object of `Complex` class with the subtracted result of the two complex numbers.

* `mulComplex(Complex)`
>This functio returns a new `Complex` object representing the product of the calling `Complex` object and the object passed as an argument to the function.
